  - Today is my first day as cyber guard of our city.
  - I heard that fossas are doing a cyber attack.
  - It is my duty to stop them.
  - I have to remind myself of the most important rules.
  - Generator is crucial without it city is in danger.
  - To charge it I can use my special button.
  - To use it I need to drag it and drop on generator.
  - Sometimes fossas will attack my pc.
  - In this case I need to turn it on with pendrive.
  - I hope my three firewalls will be enaugh.
  - Oh also my shift ends when clock on pc hits zero.
  - I need to be on high alert enything can happen.
