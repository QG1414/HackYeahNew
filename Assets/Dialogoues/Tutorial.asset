  - It will be a hard night, we are beeing hacked
  - There are a few things I need to remember
  - Generator to the right needs to be powered from time to time using button
  - I can take button from my left inventory and move it over the generator to start
    a repair
  - Sometimes hackers will attack my computer then I need to turn it on using pendrive
    and block them off
  - I think thats all I hope time displayed on the computer screen will go quickly
